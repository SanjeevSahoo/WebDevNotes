 Web Browser Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Parser - > DOM Tree (DOM)
CSS Parser  - > CSS Tree (CSSOM)

                        -> Render Tree
                                        -> Layout
                                                    -> Painting

For Any Script Execution the Parser Stops till the JS execution is completed.
Any JS Execution stops still the Depended CSS is not parsed.

All this CSS, HTML and JS parsing and execution happens in the Main Thread.

Event Loop manages the execution of all this using a message queue. Itâ€™s an infinite loop that pulls tasks such as layout, painting, and JS execution from a message queue and processes them.

 Web Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Typography

    1. Body Text Should be between 15px to 22px.
    2. Use Big Fonts for Headlines.
    3. In case of Big Fonts , reduce the Font Weight.
    4. Use line Spacing between 120% to 150%.
    5. 45 to 90 Chars per line is ideal.

2. Good Fonts

    San Serif   -   Lato, Raleway       , Used for Modern Websites
    Serif       -   Cardo, PT Serif     , Used for Traditional Websites, Storytelling 

3. Color

    1. Use only one base color.
    2. gray and white are not counted as the base color.
    3. Use Color to draw attention.
    4. Never use black for Design.

4. Images

    1. Image Overlays can be used to show text over and image. 
    2. Put Text in a box with background to make text stanout. The box should have some transparency.
    3. You can use blured image and put the text in blured area.
    4. You can also use an out of focus image area.
    5. Image with a floor fade, that means darker at the bottom.

5. Icons

    1. Can be used to show features or steps.
    2. For actions and links.
    3. Icon should be labeled if space permits.
    4. Icon should have genral meaning.
    5. Icon should not take center stage.
    6. Use Icon fonts instead of static images.
    7. Raster Images dont scale, while Vector images can scale infinitely.

6. Whitespace and Spacing

    1. use whitespace between element, group of elements, between sections etc.
    2. White space creates hirarchy.

7. How to Learn

    1. Collect designs that you like
    2. Try to understand everything about it.
    3. What these sites have common.
    4. Use developer team and inspect.
    5. Steal like an artist.

 Http Caching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The browser inspects the headers of the HTTP response generated by the web server. There are four headers commonly used for caching:

	ETag

	The ETag (or Entity Tag) is a string that serves as a cache validation token. This is usually a hash of the file contents.
	The server can include an ETag in its response, which the browser can then use this in a future request (after the file has expired) to determine if the cache contains a stale copy.
	If the hash is the same, then the resource hasn’t changed and the server responds with a 304 response code (Not Modified) with an empty body. This lets the browser know it’s still safe to use the cached copy.
	
	Cache-Control
	
	The Cache-Control header has a number of directives we can set to control cache behavior, expiration, and validation. These can be combined together as well.
	
		Cache-Control: no-store
	
	This tells the browser to always request the resource from the server
		
		Cache-Control: no-cache
		
	This one is actually a bit misleading. It doesn’t mean “do not cache”.
	
	This tells the browser to cache the file but not to use it until it checks with the server to validate we have the latest version. This validation is done with the ETag header.
	
		Cache-Control: max-age=60
	
	This specifies the length of time in seconds the resource should be cached.So a max-age=60 means that it should be cached for 1 minute. RFC 2616 recommends that the maximum value for should no longer than 1 year (max-age=31536000).
	
		Cache-Control: must-revalidate
	
	This tells the cache it must verify the status of the stale resource before using it and expired ones should not be used.
	
HTML Meta Tag

Prior to HTML5, using meta tags inside HTML to specify cache-control was a valid approach:
	
	<meta http-equiv="Cache-control" content="no-cache">
	
Using a meta tag like this is now discouraged and is not valid HTML5. Why? It’s not a good idea because only browsers will be able to parse the meta tag and understand it. Intermediate caches won’t.

Cache Busting

Cache busting is where we invalidate a cached file and force the browser to retrieve the file from the server.
We can instruct the browser to bypass the cache by simply changing the filename. To the browser, this is a completely new resource so it will fetch the resource from the server.
Cache busting also allows us to keep long max-age values for resources that may change frequently. Google recommends that max-age be set to 1 year
