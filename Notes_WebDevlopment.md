WEB BROWSERS WORK
***********************************************************

HTML Parser - > DOM Tree (DOM)
CSS Parser  - > CSS Tree (CSSOM)

                        -> Render Tree
                                        -> Layout
                                                    -> Painting

For Any Script Execution the Parser Stops till the JS execution is completed.
Any JS Execution stops still the Depended CSS is not parsed.

All this CSS, HTML and JS parsing and execution happens in the Main Thread.

Event Loop manages the execution of all this using a message queue. Itâ€™s an infinite loop that pulls tasks such as layout, painting, and JS execution from a message queue and processes them.
